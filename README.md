PayPal Here&trade; Sideloader API
==================

This project contains 3 very lightweight samples for Android, iOS & Web that show how PayPal Here &trade; can be integrade into your own projects using our Sideloader API.
___
For a brief overview of the API and what you can do with it: Have a look at our [Keynote at the MWC's WIPJam 2013](http://www.slideshare.net/PayPal/mwc-keynote) (at our [SlideShare channel](http://www.slideshare.net/PayPal/)).

Basically you need either a phone with Android or iOS with our PayPal Here&trade; app installed. To accept payments using PayPal Here&trade; you need a valid PayPal merchant account that is registered for PayPal Here in the supported countries.

The Sideloader API uses an url scheme to communicate with PayPal's app and retrieve the payment's result via a callback mechanism.

Using this allows you to accept payments via:
* Credit card
* PayPal
* Checkin
* Invoice
* Cash
